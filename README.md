# Enonic FP

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/enonic-fp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/enonic-fp)

Functional programming helpers for Enonic XP. This library provides [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) wrappers around the Enonic-interfaces provided by [enonic-types](https://github.com/ItemConsulting/enonic-types) and the official standard libraries.

## Enonic-wizardry

This library aims to _only_ provide functional wrappers for the standard libraries, and nothing else. So we recommend also installing [enonic-wizardry](https://github.com/ItemConsulting/enonic-wizardry). _Enonic-wizardry_ provides useful useful utilities and helper functions that every project needs.

## Code generation

We recommend using this library together with its sister library: [enonic-ts-codegen](https://github.com/ItemConsulting/enonic-ts-codegen). *enonic-ts-codegen* will create TypeScript `interfaces` for your content-types. Those interfaces will be very useful together with this library.

## Requirements

 1. Enonic 7 setup with Webpack
 2. Individual Enonic client libraries installed (this library only contains wrappers around the interfaces) 

## Motivation

Most functions in this library wraps the result in an [IOEither<EnonicError, A>](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/IOEither.ts.html).

This gives us two things:

 1. It forces the developer to handle the error case using `fold`
 2. It allows us to `pipe` the results from one operation into the next using `chain` (or `map`). Chain expects another
    `IOEither<EnonicError, A>` to be returned, and when the first `left<EnonicError>` is returned, the pipe will short circuit to the error case in `fold`.

This style of programming encourages us to write re-usable functions that we can compose together using `pipe`.

## Building the project

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Get content by key service

In this example we have a service that returns an article by the `key` as json. Or if something goes wrong, we return 
an _Internal Server Error_ instead.

```typescript
import { io } from "fp-ts/lib/IO";
import { fold } from "fp-ts/lib/IOEither";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/pipeable";
import { Request, Response } from "enonic-types/lib/controller";
import { get as getContent } from "enonic-fp/lib/content";
import { Article } from "../../site/content-types/article/article"; // 1

export function get(req: Request): Response { // 2
  const program = pipe( // 3
    getContent<Article>({ // 4
      key: req.params.key!
    }),
    fold( // 5
      (err) =>
        io.of(
          { // 6
            status: 500,
            body: err,
            contentType: "application/json"
          } as Response
        ),
      (content) =>
        io.of(
          { // 7
            status: 200,
            body: content.data,
            contentType: "application/json"
          }
        )
    )
  );
  
  return program(); // 8
}
```

 1. We import an `interface Article { ... }` generated by [enonic-ts-codegen](https://github.com/ItemConsulting/enonic-ts-codegen).
 2. We use the imported `Request` and `Response` to control the shape of our controller.
 3. We use the `pipe` function from *fp-ts* to pipe the result of one function into the next one.
 4. We use the `get` function from `content` – here renamed `getContent` so it won't collide with the `get` function in the controller – to return some content where the type is `IOEither<EnonicError, Content<Article>>`.
 5. The last thing we usually do in a controller is to unpack the `IOEither`. This is done with `fold(handleError, handleSuccess)`. We create two functions (`handleError`, and `handleSuccess`), that both return `IO<Response>`.
 6. We create the `Response` object for the error case
 7. We create the `Response` object for the success case
 8. We have so far constructed a constant `program` of type `IO<Response>`, but we have not yet performed a single sideeffect. It's time to perform those side effects, so we run the `IO` by calling it.


### Delete content by key and publish

In this example we delete come content by `key`. We are first doing this on the `draft` branch. And then we `publish` it
to the `master` branch. 

We will return a http error based on the type of error that happened (trough a lookup in the `errorsKeyToStatus` map). 
Or we return a http status `204`, indicating success.

```typescript
import { IO, io } from "fp-ts/lib/IO";
import { chain, fold, IOEither, map } from "fp-ts/lib/IOEither";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/pipeable";
import { Request, Response } from "enonic-types/lib/controller";
import { publish, remove } from "enonic-fp/lib/content";
import { EnonicError } from "enonic-fp/lib/errors";
import { run } from "enonic-fp/lib/context";

function del(req: Request): Response {
  const key = req.params.key!;

  const program = pipe(
    runInDraftContext(
      remove({ key }) // 1
    ),
    chain(publishContentByKey(key)),  // 2
    fold( // 3
      (err) =>
        io.of(
          {
            body: err,
            contentType: "application/json",
            status: errorKeyToStatus[err.errorKey]
          } as Response
        ),
      () =>
        io.of(
          {
            body: "",
            status: 204 // 4
          } as Response
        )
    )
  );
  
  return program(); // 5
}

export { del as delete }; // 6

/**
 * This function is found in the "enonic-wizardry" package
 */
function runInDraftContext<A>(a: IO<A>): IO<A> {
  return run<A>({
    branch: 'draft'
  })(a);
}

/**
 * This function is found in the "enonic-wizardry" package
 */
export function publishContentByKey<A>(key: string): (a: A) => IOEither<EnonicError, A> {
  return (a): IOEither<EnonicError, A> => {
    return pipe(
      publish({
        keys: [key],
        sourceBranch: 'draft',
        targetBranch: 'master',
      }),
      map(() => a)
    );
  }
}

const errorKeyToStatus: { [key: string]: number } = {
  InternalServerError: 500,
  NotFoundError: 404,
  PublishError: 500
};
```

 1. We call the `remove` function with the `key` to delete some content. We want to do this on the _draft_ branch, so we wrap the call in `runInDraftContext` (which I have copied in from the *enonic-wizardry* package for this example). Remove returns `IOEither<EnonicError, void>`. If the content didn't exist, it will return a `EnonicError` with `errorKey="NotFoundError"`, that can be handled in the `fold`.
 2. We want to publish our change from the _draft_ branch to the _master_ branch. So we call another function that we have copied in from *enonic-wizardry*, called `publishContentByKey`.
 3.To create our `Response` we call `fold`, where we handle the error and success cases, and return `IO<Response>`.
 4. Since this is a delete operation we return a `204` on the success case, which means "no content".
 5. We have so far constructed a constant `program` of type `IO<Response>`, but we have not yet performed a single sideeffect. It's time to perform those side effects, so we run the `IO` by calling it.
 6. Since delete is a keyword in JavaScript and TypeScript, we have to do this hack to return the `delete` function.

### Multiple queries, and http request

In this example we do 3 queries. First we look up an article by `key`, then we search for comments related to that 
article based on the articles key. And then we get a list of open positions in the company, that we want to display on
the web page.

The first two are queries in Enonic, and the last one is over http. We do a `sequenceT` taking the 3 `Either<Error, T>`
as input, and getting an Either with the results in a tuple (`Either<Error, [Content, QueryResponse, any]>`).

We then `map` over the tuple, and create an object with all the data, that can be returned to the user.

In the `fold` we either return the an error, with the correct http status (`404`, `500` or `502`), or we return the
result with the http status `200`.

```typescript
import { sequenceT } from "fp-ts/lib/Apply";
import { parseJSON } from "fp-ts/lib/Either";
import { io } from "fp-ts/lib/IO";
import { chain, fold, fromEither, ioEither, IOEither, map } from "fp-ts/lib/IOEither";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/pipeable";
import { Request, Response } from "enonic-types/lib/controller";
import { QueryResponse } from "enonic-types/lib/content";
import { HttpResponse } from "enonic-types/lib/http";
import { EnonicError } from "enonic-fp/lib/errors";
import { get as getContent, query } from "enonic-fp/lib/content";
import { request } from "enonic-fp/lib/http";
import { Article } from "../../site/content-types/article/article";
import { Comment } from "../../site/content-types/comment/comment";

export function get(req: Request): Response {
  const articleKey = req.params.key!!;

  const program = pipe(
    sequenceT(ioEither)(
      getContent<Article>({ key: articleKey }),
      getCommentsByArticleKey(articleKey),
      getOpenPositionsOverHttp()
    ),
    map(([article, comments, openPositions]) =>
      ({
        ...article,
        comments: comments.hits,
        openPositions
      })
    ),
    fold(
      (err: EnonicError) =>
        io.of(
          {
            body: err,
            contentType: "application/json",
            status: errorKeyToStatus[err.errorKey]
          } as Response
        ),
      (res) =>
        io.of(
          {
            body: res,
            contentType: "application/json",
            status: 200
          }
        )
    )
  );

  return program();
}

const errorKeyToStatus: { [key: string]: number } = {
  BadGatewayError: 502,
  InternalServerError: 500,
  NotFoundError: 404
};

function getCommentsByArticleKey(
  articleId: string
): IOEither<EnonicError, QueryResponse<Comment>> {
  return query({
    contentTypes: ["com.example:comment"],
    count: 100,
    query: `data.articleId = ${articleId}`
  });
}

function getOpenPositionsOverHttp(): IOEither<EnonicError, any> {
  return pipe(
    request({
      url: "https://example.com/api/open-positions"
    }),
    chain((res: HttpResponse) =>
      fromEither(
        parseJSON(res.body!, (reason: any) =>
          ({
            cause: String(reason),
            errorKey: "BadGatewayError"
          } as EnonicError)
        )
      )
    )
  );
}
```
