# Internal Server Error

## Details

Something has gone wrong serverside. This can be anything, but it is most likely something that can be fixed by updating
the serverside code.

## Solution

 1. The `title` value of the `EnonicError` will tell you what is wrong.
 2. You should show an error message to your users urging them to file an error report.
